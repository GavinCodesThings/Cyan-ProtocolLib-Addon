# Cyan-Packet-Lib
Cyan is a library that allows you to modify sent and received packets, You can also send individual packets to players.

## How it is different from other packet/protocol libraries
It is different because it is easier to use, instead of writing to ints of specific indexes, you just write to the variables provided to you.

## Notes
This is made specifically for 1.8.8 Bukkit servers, but more compatability may be added in the future.

## Credits
Some of the code may be from ProtocolLib (because I have no idea what I am doing and have no knowledge of NMS whatsoever, so some credit goes to them).
